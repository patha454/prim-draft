/**
 * @file types.h 
 * @brief Type definitions used by Prim.
 *
 * Prim is designed to be built into arbitrary software components: Prim could
 * be used as part of an operating system kernel or user program, as a 
 * standalone executable or library on hardware with different native word 
 * sizes.
 *
 * Many binary formats specify exact widths for their data type, but C's 
 * built-in types have no guaranteed widths - only minimum guaranteed widths.
 * C's fixed width datatypes defined in <stdint.h> originate in ISO C99, which
 * is supported by most, but <em>not all<em> compilers. 
 *
 * Prim uses its own typedefâ€™s types whenever a fixed width is required, which
 * maximises the host platforms available to Prim. This file, platform/types.h,
 * should be edited when porting Prim to a new platform, so the types in this
 * file have the correct widths on the target platform.
 *
 * @attention This version of platform/types.h is setup for compiling Prim in 
 * an environment which supports ISO C99's <stdin.h>.
